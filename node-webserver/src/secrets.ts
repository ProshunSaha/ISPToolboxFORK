// ABOUT THIS NODE.JS SAMPLE: This sample is part of the AWS Secrets Manager.
// In this sample we only handle the specific exceptions for the 'GetSecretValue' API.
// If you need more information about configurations or implementing the sample code, visit the AWS docs:
// https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/nodejs/

// Load the AWS SDK
var AWS = require("aws-sdk"),
  region = "us-west-1";

const credentials = new AWS.Credentials(
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
);
// Create a Secrets Manager client
var client = new AWS.SecretsManager({
  region: region,
  credentials,
});

// In this sample we only handle the specific exceptions for the 'GetSecretValue' API.
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html
// We rethrow the exception by default.

export async function getSecretValue(secretName: string) {
  return JSON.parse(
    (await client.getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretName }).promise())
