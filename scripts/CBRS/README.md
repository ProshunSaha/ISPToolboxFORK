## Scripts used for aggregating and processing CBRS data
- May be useful for aggregating other FCC auction data with a similar format
    - See aggregateCSV.py

## Steps used to create overlay:
Auction results shouldn't really change so I don't know why you would have to do it.  Here it is for reference though:

- Run `aggregateCSV.py` on CBRS license results CSV downloaded from: https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105/reports/results_by_license
- This script aggregates license results by county.

- Copy generated csv data (county_aggregated_results.csv) to SQL db.  (Make sure cbrs_data is a fresh table see: `sql/cbrs_table.sql`)
```
PGPASSWORD=<db-password> psql -h isptoolbox-db-monthly-update.cahmkzzberpf.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U fbcmasteruser -d postgres -c "\copy cbrs_data(state, countycode, county, price, companies, licensecounts) FROM 'county_aggregated_results.csv' delimiter ',' csv"
```

- Create the `cbrs_agg` table to hold aggregated cbrs info with geography (see `sql/cbrs_agg.sql`).
- Run `cbrs.sql` to join country geography to the `cbrs_agg` table.
- Export shapefile and upload to mapbox:
```
pgsql2shp -f cbrs.shp -h isptoolbox-db-monthly-update.cahmkzzberpf.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -u fbcmasteruser -P <db-password> postgres "SELECT geog, price, companies, licensecounts, county, countycode, state, statecode FROM cbrs_agg"
```
